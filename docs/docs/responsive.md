  <a href="/docs/themeable" class="badge m-0 d-flex align-items-center compatability-badge">
    <span class="badge-check">
      <img src="/img/icons/check.svg" />
    </span>
    <span>Responsive</span>
  </a>
</span> badge it means the component has responsive breakpoints for different sized screens. Similar to Bootstrap, we support `lg` and `sm` device breakpoints. The breakpoint is anything 600px or wider is considered `lg` and anything under 600px is `sm`.

Not everything that is responsive uses these names. For example the `.container`is responsive by default and expands and contracts on different screens.
