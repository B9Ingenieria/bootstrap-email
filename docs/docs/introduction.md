# Introduction

##### Welcome to Bootstap Email! Happy to see you here :)
Bootstrap Email is a Bootstrap 4 stylesheet, compiler, and inliner for responsive and consistent emails with the Bootstrap syntax you know and love.

### So how does it work?
Bootstrap Email works by taking HTML marked up with supported Bootstrap classes and compiles it down into `<table>` tags and inlines styles that are required to get HTML emails looking nice across all email clients.
